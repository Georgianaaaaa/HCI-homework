			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>
            It's Friday and Christian has to go to work. Unfortunately, he did not hear the alarm and woke up 30 minutes later than usual. He hurriedly prepares for work, this time skipping coffee. Start the car and go to work. Hellish traffic !!! He is already very late and he is convinced that the boss will be upset. Will there be any parking space available near the workplace? He remembers the Smart Parking application. He opens it and decides to use it so as not to waste even more time looking for a parking space. Indeed, the company's parking lots are all occupied, but the application suggests a parking space behind the building, on a side street. Luckily for Smart Parking, Christian would not be able to get to work even today because of the parking space.
